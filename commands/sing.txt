  console.log(info.formats);
});
Cookies Support
const ytdl = require("@distube/ytdl-core");

// (Optional) Below are examples, NOT the recommended options
const cookies = [
  { name: "cookie1", value: "COOKIE1_HERE" },
  { name: "cookie2", value: "COOKIE2_HERE" },
];

// (Optional) http-cookie-agent / undici agent options
// Below are examples, NOT the recommended options
const agentOptions = {
  pipelining: 5,
  maxRedirections: 0,
  localAddress: "127.0.0.1",
};

// agent should be created once if you don't want to change your cookie
const agent = ytdl.createAgent(cookies, agentOptions);

ytdl.getBasicInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent });
ytdl.getInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent });
How to get cookies
Install EditThisCookie extension for your browser.
Go to YouTube.
Log in to your account. (You should use a new account for this purpose)
Click on the extension icon and click "Export" icon.
Your cookies will be added to your clipboard and paste it into your code.
[!WARNING] Don't logout it by clicking logout button on youtube/google account manager, it will expire your cookies. You can delete your browser's cookies to log it out on your browser. Or use incognito mode to get your cookies then close it.

[!WARNING] Paste all the cookies array from clipboard into createAgent function. Don't remove/edit any cookies if you don't know what you're doing.

[!WARNING] Make sure your account, which logged in when you getting your cookies, use 1 IP at the same time only. It will make your cookies alive longer.

const ytdl = require("@distube/ytdl-core");
const agent = ytdl.createAgent([
  {
    domain: ".youtube.com",
    expirationDate: 1234567890,
    hostOnly: false,
    httpOnly: true,
    name: "---xxx---",
    path: "/",
    sameSite: "no_restriction",
    secure: true,
    session: false,
    value: "---xxx---",
  },
  {
    "...": "...",
  },
]);
Or you can paste your cookies array into a file and use fs.readFileSync to read it.
const ytdl = require("@distube/ytdl-core");
const fs = require("fs");
const agent = ytdl.createAgent(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("cookies.json")));
Proxy Support
const ytdl = require("@distube/ytdl-core");

const agent = ytdl.createProxyAgent({ uri: "my.proxy.server" });

ytdl.getBasicInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent });
ytdl.getInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent });
Use both proxy and cookies:

const ytdl = require("@distube/ytdl-core");

const agent = ytdl.createProxyAgent({ uri: "my.proxy.server" }, [{ name: "cookie", value: "COOKIE_HERE" }]);

ytdl.getBasicInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent });
ytdl.getInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent });
IP Rotation
Built-in ip rotation (getRandomIPv6) won't be updated and will be removed in the future, create your own ip rotation instead.

To implement IP rotation, you need to assign the desired IP address to the localAddress property within undici.Agent.Options. Therefore, you'll need to use a different ytdl.Agent for each IP address you want to use.

const ytdl = require("@distube/ytdl-core");
const { getRandomIPv6 } = require("@distube/ytdl-core/lib/utils");

const agentForARandomIP = ytdl.createAgent(undefined, {
  localAddress: getRandomIPv6("2001:2::/48"),
});

ytdl.getBasicInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent: agentForARandomIP });

const agentForAnotherRandomIP = ytdl.createAgent(undefined, {
  localAddress: getRandomIPv6("2001:2::/48"),
});

ytdl.getInfo("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ", { agent: agentForAnotherRandomIP });
API
You can find the API documentation in the original repo. Except a few changes:

ytdl.getInfoOptions
requestOptions is now undici's RequestOptions.
agent: ytdl.Agent
playerClients: An array of player clients to use. Accepts WEB, WEB_EMBEDDED, TV, IOS, and ANDROID. Defaults to ["WEB_EMBEDDED", "IOS", "ANDROID","TV"].
fetch: Custom fetch implementation. Defaults to undici's request.
ytdl.createAgent([cookies]): ytdl.Agent
cookies: an array of json cookies exported with EditThisCookie.

ytdl.createProxyAgent(proxy[, cookies]): ytdl.Agent
proxy: ProxyAgentOptions contains your proxy server information.

How to implement ytdl.Agent with your own Dispatcher
You can find the example here

Limitations
ytdl cannot download videos that fall into the following

Regionally restricted (requires a proxy)
Private (if you have access, requires cookies)
Rentals (if you have access, requires cookies)
YouTube Premium content (if you have access, requires cookies)
Only HLS Livestreams are currently supported. Other formats will get filtered out in ytdl.chooseFormats
Generated download links are valid for 6 hours, and may only be downloadable from the same IP address.

Rate Limiting
When doing too many requests YouTube might block. This will result in your requests getting denied with HTTP-StatusCode 429. The following steps might help you:

Update @distube/ytdl-core to the latest version
Use proxies (you can find an example here)
Extend the Proxy Idea by rotating (IPv6-)Addresses
read this for more information about this
Use cookies (you can find an example here)
for this to take effect you have to FIRST wait for the current rate limit to expire
Wait it out (it usually goes away within a few days)
Update Checks
The issue of using an outdated version of ytdl-core became so prevalent, that ytdl-core now checks for updates at run time, and every 12 hours. If it finds an update, it will print a warning to the console advising you to update. Due to the nature of this library, it is important to always use the latest version as YouTube continues to update.

If you'd like to disable this update check, you can do so by providing the YTDL_NO_UPDATE env variable.

env YTDL_NO_UPDATE=1 node myapp.js
